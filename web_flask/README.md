A web framework is a software framework designed to support the development of web applications, including web services, web resources, and web APIs.

It provides a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web.

Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development, such as routing URLs to appropriate handlers, interacting with databases, templating HTML responses, managing sessions, and providing security.
